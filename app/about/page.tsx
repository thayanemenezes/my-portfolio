              in August 2019, I had my first internship opportunity in the IT
              area. I started my professional journey working as a graphic
              designer and web designer, in the meantime, I entered the Computer
              Science university and prepared myself for an opportunity as a
              developer. In May 2021, I got this opportunity, and since then I
              have been focused on deepening my knowledge on the front end with
              ReactJS and Next.Js, and on the backend with NodeJs and NestJs.
              But on my journey, I&apos;ve had the opportunity to work with
              several languages, such as Python, Dart, C++.{" "}

              Last year, I had the opportunity to lead a squad of three people,
              where I comprehensively applied the concepts of agile methodology.
              During this period, I conducted activities such as backlog
              refinement, sprint planning, assigning scores to tasks and
              prioritizing demands. Furthermore, I focused on teamwork,
              promoting collaboration and sharing knowledge continuously.
